## Prerequisties
- CMake
- A C++ compiler
- Git (CMake will fetch SFML automatically)

## Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The executable is placed at `./build/pathfinding_visualizer`.

## Run
```bash
./build/pathfinding_visualizer
```

## Controls
- Left mouse drag: paint obstacles
- Right mouse drag: erase obstacles
- `S`: set start at the hovered cell
- `G`: set goal at the hovered cell
- `Enter`: start or restart the search
- `R`: reset the current search overlays
- `C`: clear all obstacles

The open list, closed list, and final path are highlighted in distinct colors as the search progresses.
